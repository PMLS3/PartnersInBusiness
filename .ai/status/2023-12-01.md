# Session Update: 2023-12-01

## Development Steps

1. `dataconnect/schema/schema.gql`: Updated schema with proper @table directives
   - Added @table to WorkspaceTheme, WorkspaceSettings, ProfileSocial, ProfilePrivacy
   - Fixed table names and key configurations
   - Resolved linter errors for embedded types

2. `shared/server/api/workspace/create.post.ts`: Refactored workspace creation endpoint
   - Switched to direct DataConnect mutation calls
   - Removed abstracted function imports
   - Added proper error handling for DataConnect operations
   - Updated payload structure to match schema

3. `shared/utils/firebase-server.ts`: Created Firebase server utility
   - Added DataConnect initialization
   - Configured emulator connections
   - Added token-based authentication support

4. `shared/types/api.ts`: Created API type definitions
   - Added interfaces for all entities (User, Workspace, Profile)
   - Added response and error type definitions
   - Ensured type safety across API endpoints

## Key Decisions

- Adopted direct DataConnect mutation pattern over abstracted functions for better schema alignment
- Added @table directives to all referenced types to maintain proper database structure
- Implemented token-based authentication in API endpoints
- Standardized error handling across all DataConnect operations

## Next Steps

1. Update remaining API endpoints to use direct DataConnect operations:
   - Registration endpoint
   - Profile creation endpoint
   - Workspace joining endpoint

2. Implement proper query operations:
   - Fix vector search queries
   - Update operation names to match schema
   - Add proper filtering and pagination

3. Add proper validation:
   - Input validation for all endpoints
   - Schema validation for DataConnect operations
   - Authentication and authorization checks

Progress: Completed core DataConnect integration and schema structure. Next session will focus on updating remaining endpoints and implementing proper validation.
