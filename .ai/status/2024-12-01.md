# Project Timeline

## December 2023

### Session Update: 2023-12-01

#### Development Steps
1. `dataconnect/schema/schema.gql`: Updated schema with proper @table directives
   - Added @table to WorkspaceTheme, WorkspaceSettings, ProfileSocial, ProfilePrivacy
   - Fixed table names and key configurations
   - Resolved linter errors for embedded types

2. `shared/server/api/workspace/create.post.ts`: Refactored workspace creation endpoint
   - Switched to direct DataConnect mutation calls
   - Removed abstracted function imports
   - Added proper error handling for DataConnect operations
   - Updated payload structure to match schema

3. `shared/utils/firebase-server.ts`: Created Firebase server utility
   - Added DataConnect initialization
   - Configured emulator connections
   - Added token-based authentication support

4. `shared/types/api.ts`: Created API type definitions
   - Added interfaces for all entities (User, Workspace, Profile)
   - Added response and error type definitions
   - Ensured type safety across API endpoints

#### Initial Firebase Setup
1. Initialized Firebase project with multiple features:
   - Data Connect setup with local files and SDK generation
   - Firestore configuration with rules and indexes
   - Genkit setup with Cloud Functions (TypeScript)
   - Additional Cloud Functions codebase "partnersinbiz" (JavaScript)
   - Cloud Storage with security rules
   - Firebase Emulators configuration
   - Remote Config template setup
   - Extensions support

#### Project Structure
- `firebase.json` - Main configuration
- `.firebaserc` - Project settings
- `firestore.rules` - Firestore security rules
- `firestore.indexes.json` - Firestore indexes
- `storage.rules` - Storage security rules
- `remoteconfig.template.json` - Remote Config template
- `functions/` - Main Cloud Functions directory (TypeScript)
- `partnersinbiz/` - Secondary Functions codebase (JavaScript)
- `dataconnect/` - Data Connect configuration and schemas

## March 2024

### Session Update: 2024-03-21

#### Development Steps
1. `dataconnect/connector/mutations.gql`: Fixed DataConnect mutation syntax
   - Simplified input types using *_Data types
   - Removed field selections from mutation responses
   - Changed array append to push operation
   - Used proper key types throughout

2. `dataconnect/connector/queries.gql`: Updated query structure
   - Fixed field names (user_workspaces â†’ userWorkspaces)
   - Changed contains to has for array fields
   - Changed contains to ilike for text search
   - Removed vector search and _score fields
   - Used proper key types for all operations

3. `.ai/features/account.md`: Updated documentation to use one-person-empire package
   - Replaced direct DataConnect usage with generated client
   - Added proper error handling examples
   - Updated operation patterns to match actual implementation
   - Added Firebase server initialization

4. Fixed implementation patterns:
   - Added token handling for all operations
   - Included proper error handling
   - Added UUID generation
   - Structured operations to match generated client

5. Added new learnings to codex:
   - L013: DataConnect KeyOutput types handling
   - L014: DataConnect query parameters and key types
   - L015: DataConnect array and text operations

#### Key Decisions
- Switched to standard text search with ilike instead of vector search
- Standardized on *_Data and *_Key types for DataConnect operations
- Simplified mutation responses by removing field selections
- Changed array operations to use push instead of append
- Adopted one-person-empire package for DataConnect operations
- Implemented consistent error handling pattern
- Added Firebase server initialization to all operations

#### Current Focus
1. API Endpoint Updates:
   - `/server/api/auth/register.post.ts`
   - `/server/api/workspace/create.post.ts`
   - `/server/api/profile/create.post.ts`

2. Utility Functions:
   - Error handling utilities
   - Firebase server initialization wrapper
   - Response formatting
   - Input validation
   - Response validation

3. TypeScript Types:
   - *_Data input types
   - *_Key parameter types
   - Query response types
   - Request/response payloads
   - Error types
   - Operation result types

4. Client-side Updates:
   - DataConnect composables
   - Search functionality components
   - Workspace management code

Progress: Project has evolved from initial Firebase setup to a more structured implementation using the one-person-empire package, with improved error handling and type safety. Focus has shifted from direct DataConnect usage to a more maintainable and type-safe approach.
