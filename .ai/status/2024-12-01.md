# Status Update: 2024-01-12

## Completed Tasks

1. Initialized Firebase project with multiple features:
   - Data Connect setup with local files and SDK generation
   - Firestore configuration with rules and indexes
   - Genkit setup with Cloud Functions (TypeScript)
   - Additional Cloud Functions codebase "partnersinbiz" (JavaScript)
   - Cloud Storage with security rules
   - Firebase Emulators configuration
   - Remote Config template setup
   - Extensions support

## Project Structure Updates

New Firebase-related files and directories:
- `firebase.json` - Main configuration
- `.firebaserc` - Project settings
- `firestore.rules` - Firestore security rules
- `firestore.indexes.json` - Firestore indexes
- `storage.rules` - Storage security rules
- `remoteconfig.template.json` - Remote Config template
- `functions/` - Main Cloud Functions directory (TypeScript)
- `partnersinbiz/` - Secondary Functions codebase (JavaScript)
- `dataconnect/` - Data Connect configuration and schemas

## Emulator Configuration

Local development environment setup with emulators:
- Authentication: Port 9099
- Functions: Port 5001
- Firestore: Port 8080
- Storage: Port 9199
- Data Connect: Port 9399
- Emulator UI enabled

## Next Steps

1. Set up proper security rules for Firestore and Storage
2. Configure Data Connect queries and mutations
3. Implement initial Cloud Functions
4. Set up local development workflow using emulators
5. Create deployment pipeline for Firebase services

## Notes

- Project is linked to Firebase project: omni-connect-9b23d
- Multiple Cloud Function codebases will need coordination for deployment
- Node.js version compatibility warnings noted during installation
