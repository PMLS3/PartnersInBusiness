# Session Update: 2024-09-09

## Development Steps

1. `composables/useAccount.ts`: Enhanced account creation process
   - Implemented automatic creation of main workspace and user profile
   - Added error handling for each step of the process
   - Utilized `makeUUID()` for generating unique identifiers for workspace and profile
   - Updated `createItem` calls to exclude `uid` from embedding text generation
2. `composables/useAccount.ts`: Updated loginAccount function
   - Implemented user login with Firebase authentication
   - Added functionality to fetch user data, workspaces, and profiles
   - Set up state management for user, workspaces, and profiles

## Key Decisions

- Decided to create a main workspace and user profile automatically upon account creation
- Chose to use `makeUUID()` for generating unique identifiers for workspace and profile
- Opted to use the `uid` from Firebase for the user account
- Excluded `uid` from embedding text generation to focus on relevant user data
- Decided to fetch all user-related data (workspaces and profiles) during login for immediate access
- Chose to store workspaces and profiles in separate reactive state variables for flexibility

## Next Steps

1. Implement user authentication flow using Firebase
2. Create a dashboard component to display user, workspace, and profile information
3. Develop a workspace switcher component for users with multiple workspaces
4. Implement error handling and user feedback throughout the application
5. Create unit tests for the `useAccount` composable
6. Implement a user dashboard component to display the main workspace and profile information
7. Create a workspace switcher functionality to allow users to change between their workspaces
8. Develop a profile editor component for users to update their workspace-specific profiles
9. Implement error handling and loading states for the login process
10. Create a logout function that clears all user-related state

Progress: Completed the enhanced account creation process with automatic workspace and profile setup. Next session will focus on implementing the user authentication flow and creating the dashboard component. Enhanced the login functionality to include comprehensive user data fetching. Next session will focus on implementing the user dashboard and workspace management features.
